# TourNest

## Overview
TourNest is a comprehensive web platform designed to unify hotel and tour package management, offering a modern, centralized solution to the industry's current challenges.

In most small and medium-sized hotels, room management and tour sales are handled separately, often with manual records. This leads to overbooking, loss of information, inefficiency in promotions, and difficulties with financial reporting.

With TourNest, both hotels and travel agencies will be able to manage rooms, reservations, tour packages, and payments from a single system, with real-time availability and differentiated access for administrators, receptionists, and guests.

The system will also incorporate Artificial Intelligence tools, such as personalized package recommendations, occupancy prediction for dynamic pricing management, a customer service chatbot, and automatic reporting on tourism trends.

Its target audience includes small and medium-sized hotels, local travel agencies, and traveling clients looking for a convenient and reliable experience when booking accommodations and tours in one place.

In its MVP (Minimum Viable Product), TourNest will allow:

Administrator: manage rooms, tour packages, basic payments, and simple reporting.

Customer: register, check availability, book rooms, select packages, and review payment status.

AI-powered extras: a basic chatbot and initial package recommendations.

With this approach, TourNest aims to become an innovative and scalable solution that not only optimizes hotel and tourism management but also improves the customer experience and increases the competitiveness of local hotels and agencies.
